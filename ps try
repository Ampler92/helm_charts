Streaming logs from a Kubernetes pod directly via the Kubernetes API without using kubectl and without dealing with WebSocket complexities in PowerShell involves using the HTTP GET request to the log streaming API endpoint. The logs API (/api/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/pods/{pod}/log) supports streaming logs without upgrading to WebSockets, making it simpler for scenarios like this.Hereâ€™s how you can achieve it in PowerShell:PrerequisitesEnsure you have a valid Bearer token for authentication with the Kubernetes API server. This token must be included in the HTTP request headers for authorization.PowerShell Script ExampleThis example demonstrates how to stream logs from a specific pod using the Kubernetes REST API. It uses the Invoke-RestMethod cmdlet available in PowerShell to make a GET request to the logs endpoint.# Variables
$apiServer = "https://<your-kubernetes-api-server>"
$namespace = "your-namespace"
$podName = "your-pod-name"
$token = "your-bearer-token"

# Kubernetes API endpoint for pod logs
$logUrl = "$apiServer/api/v1/namespaces/$namespace/pods/$podName/log?follow=true"

# Headers for authentication
$headers = @{
    Authorization = "Bearer $token"
}

# Stream the logs
try {
    # Note: This request will keep the connection open and stream logs continuously
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $logUrl -Headers $headers -Method Get -Stream
    foreach ($line in $response) {
        # Process each line of log output here
        Write-Output $line
    }
}
catch {
    Write-Error "Failed to stream logs: $_"
}
Replace <your-kubernetes-api-server>, your-namespace, your-pod-name, and your-bearer-token with your actual Kubernetes API server address, namespace, pod name, and a valid Bearer token, respectively.Important NotesAPI Server URL: Ensure you use the correct protocol (https) and API server address. The API server URL is typically something like https://<api-server-address>.Authentication:
